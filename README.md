# Bliss

This is my first project and it is a music player, it plays existing .mp4 files and can form a playlist if a folder is uploaded.
It has functional buttons to pause, play and to move to the next or previous song.
But the part I'm most proud of is the beautiful GUI I have created using handdrawn custom buttons and a png image borrowed from the internet (plus some of my magic).
